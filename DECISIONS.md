# Decision log

Decisions this repository's code points at. A number is handed out once and never reused or
renumbered, so a citation stays resolvable; a decision which gets overturned keeps its entry,
marked as superseded and naming the entry which replaced it.

A citation in code reads `see decision 3 in the repository's DECISIONS.md`, and it names an entry
of THIS repository only.

The numbers were handed out by the implementation plan in [`docs/`](docs/README.md), so that every
story could cite its decision before the code existed. An entry is added here by the story which
first relies on it, under the number the plan gave it; that is why numbers are missing below. The
drafts of the missing ones are in
[`docs/architecture/02-design-decisions.md`](docs/architecture/02-design-decisions.md).

### 1. The adapter is native, and the Camunda 8 adapter is its template

ZenBPM is a remote, at-least-once, polling BPMS with a query API, which is the shape the Camunda 8
adapter was written for. It is NOT built on the Process-Engine-API adapter: no Process-Engine-API
implementation for ZenBPM exists, the adapter would have had to write one against its own private
command classes, and every capability the PEA cannot express (finding a workflow, listeners, versions,
pushing variables, typed failures) is one ZenBPM's REST API offers and the PEA layer would have hidden.
What is borrowed from the PEA adapter is the raw-XML handling, because a model type of a Camunda
artifact would tie this adapter to Camunda for no reason.

### 3. The REST client is the adapter's own, the gRPC stubs are generated

The adapter uses about twenty REST endpoints. The official Java client trails the engine by two
minors, changed its deploy contract with 1.8, and knows nothing about Quarkus; a generated REST client
would bring a generator into every build and its own reflection into every native image. So the REST
side is a thin `java.net.http` + Jackson client written against the copy of `openapi/api.yaml` this
repository pins, with one method per endpoint and one exception carrying the status code. The job
stream is generated from the pinned `zenbpm.proto`, because that is what protobuf is for. The pinned
copies name the engine commit they came from, and a test diffs them against the image the
integration tests run.

### 13. A class opens its fields one by one, not as a whole

The deployment service, the process service and the engine client of this adapter hold many
fields, most of them collaborators nobody outside the class needs. Which of them a caller may read
belongs to the surface of the class, so an accessor is declared per field, and Lombok's `@Getter`
on the class is refused even where an IDE offers it: it would publish the current field list and
then keep publishing whatever field a later change adds.
`@SuppressWarnings("LombokGetterMayBeUsed")` on such a class keeps that offer from coming back.

### 15. One pinned engine version, no release lines

The adapter needs at least the engine's job lock per subscription with its extension (engine commit
`071460cc`: lock per subscription, lock extension, `lock_until`), because the adapter's task
delivery is built on it, and no release carried it when the adapter was started. So during
development the pin is a commit of the engine's `main` and the digest of the image built from it;
before the adapter's first release it becomes an engine release tag. At startup the adapter logs the
engine's version and commit from `GET /system/status` and warns where the commit is not the tested
one. It does not compare versions: the version an engine on `main` reports is the last release's,
the same for every build since. Beyond that the adapter compiles against no engine artifact, so no
pin decides anything else; the REST contract is the copy of `api.yaml` this repository ships, and
the integration tests run against the pinned image. Supported means tested: the pinned image and
nothing newer. Release lines are what Camunda 8 needs because its client is the minimum cluster;
here they would be branches for a contract which has no stability promise yet. If an engine minor
breaks the surface the adapter uses, the answer is a new adapter release against the new pin, and
this entry is revisited.

### 16. The adapter follows VanillaBP's adapter conventions although another organisation owns it

`zenbpm-vanillabp-adapter` belongs to the ZenBPM maintainers at pbinitiative, implements VanillaBP's
adapter SPI and is read by people who know the Camunda and Process-Engine-API adapters. It therefore
keeps their shape: the `core` / `spring-boot` / `quarkus` split with platform modules which only
construct and register, Spotless with the platform's formatting conventions, coverage measured per
platform with the same gate and rule, `test-utils` in every test, a `DECISIONS.md` as the only thing
code cites, a user-facing wiki and a contributor-facing README, and configuration under
`vanillabp.adapters.<id>.*` validated at startup with guiding messages. What differs is what
ownership decides: the licence, the coordinates (groupId `org.pbinitiative.zenbpm`, packages
`org.pbinitiative.zenbpmadapter`), the CI and where releases are published. The Go conventions of the engine repository do not reach into this one.

### 17. Code adapted from the Apache-2.0 adapters keeps its licence and its notice

The repository is MIT-licensed, and a good part of its first version is copied and adapted from
`camunda8-adapter` and `process-engine-api-adapter`, both Apache 2.0. Apache 2.0 allows that inside an
MIT project as long as the licence text and the attributions travel with the code, so every adapted
file keeps its original header, `LICENSE-APACHE-2.0` holds the licence text, and `NOTICE` names the two
origins. The VanillaBP adapters write no header into their Java files, so an adapted Java file gets
one naming its origin, that it was adapted, and `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`. A file
written from scratch carries the MIT header with `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`. Which is which is decided when the file is
created and never changed afterwards, because the origin of a file is a fact and not a preference.
