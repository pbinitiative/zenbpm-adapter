# Proves what publish-snapshots.yaml relies on, without GitHub and without credentials:
#
#   1. A green build deploys exactly the published files: the jar, the sources jar and the POM of
#      the core, the Spring Boot module and the two Quarkus modules, and the parent's POM. No file
#      missing, and nothing else, so nothing of the test, report or gate modules either.
#   2. A red coverage gate deploys nothing at all, although every module before the gate built.
#
# Both runs work on a copy of the working tree (tracked and modified files) and deploy into a
# directory of their own. Neither installs into the local Maven repository, so the untested
# method of the second run never reaches ~/.m2. PublicationSafetyTest checks on every build that
# the settings this rests on are still there; run this script after changing anything about
# deploying, the module order or the gate. It needs spi-for-java and adapter-platform-integration
# in the local Maven repository, like any build here, and takes two full builds.
