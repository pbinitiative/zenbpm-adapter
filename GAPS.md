# Gaps

What the ZenBPM engine cannot do that VanillaBP's adapter contract asks for, the evidence for it in
the engine's source (paths relative to the root of `pbinitiative/zenbpm`), and how this adapter
behaves instead. Users read the same list, one sentence per gap, on the wiki page `Deviations`.

The numbers were handed out by the implementation plan in [`docs/`](docs/README.md), so every story
which meets a gap cites the same number. An entry is added here by the story which first makes it
true; that is why numbers are missing below. The drafts of the missing ones are in
[`docs/architecture/03-deviations-and-gaps.md`](docs/architecture/03-deviations-and-gaps.md).

What the engine lacks is true today. How the adapter answers it is marked *planned* until the code
doing it is merged, together with the test which holds it.
